# Modern Tetris made in Unity

### How to Play
It uses the default control from famous Tetris copies:
* Left/Right arrow to move
* Up arrow/Z key to rotate
* Spacebar to hard drop
* C to hold

### Main features it has
* ARR and DAS set to the default value from Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 (ARR 2F, DAS 11F)
* Next preview of the blocks, and hold key
* Hard drop

### TO-DO:
* Holding down the down arrow key won't continuously drop the piece. Currently you have to spam down arrow key to soft drop
* SRS is not working as intended, as some wall kicks are not able to be done
* Show 5 blocks of next blocks (referenced by Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, it shows 5)
* Add main menu
* Add settings menu to change controls
* Score feature
